# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the original project was run yarn start, but I installed npm, therefore I run in the directory project:

### `npm install`

### `npm audit fix `

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.
